## 🔒 Security Features

- CSRF Protection
- SQL Injection Prevention
- XSS Protection
- Role-based Access Control
- Secure Password Hashing
- Session Management

## 📊 API Documentation

The system includes RESTful APIs for mobile app integration:
- Student API endpoints
- Parent API endpoints
- Authentication APIs

## 🧪 Running Tests

The tests need MySQL or MariaDB (the migrations use MySQL-specific SQL) and a
database whose name ends in `_test`; they refuse to run against any other
database because they drop every table.

```bash
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE eschool_test"
php artisan test
```

The database host, user and password come from `.env`. GitHub Actions runs the
same tests on every pull request, together with `flutter analyze` for both apps
and the documentation build (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
