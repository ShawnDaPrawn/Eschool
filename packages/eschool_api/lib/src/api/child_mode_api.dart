  /// startChildMode
  /// Child mode in the parent app (Action Plan 4.2), guardian side: a parent-app sign-in (role Parent, school.context, current policies accepted). Only the child&#39;s approving guardian (active link with the approval right, verified email) may set the PIN or start child mode, and only for a junior-stage child with a current guardian approval. Another family&#39;s or another school&#39;s child answers 404. Private, never cached. Starts a child session with the PIN and returns the child token, short-lived and bound to this child and school. Wrong PINs are counted per child; after five the PIN locks for 15 minutes (429). Starting again from the same parent-app sign-in ends the earlier child session.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// * [child]
  /// * [childModePinEntry]
  /// * [xSchoolId] - The school to work in, one of the signed-in user's schools (`schools` in `/me/context`). Without it the request works in the user's first school. A school the user is not an active member of is refused with 403. Apps send it on every call once a school is chosen.
  /// * [xAccountId] - Expected authenticated account for a pinned private view. A mismatch is refused before school data is read or an operation is replayed. This header never grants authority. Older clients may omit it.
  /// * [cancelToken] - A [CancelToken] that can be used to cancel the operation
  /// * [headers] - Can be used to add additional headers to the request
  /// * [extras] - Can be used to add flags to the request
  /// * [validateStatus] - A [ValidateStatus] callback that can be used to determine request success based on the HTTP status of the response
  /// * [onSendProgress] - A [ProgressCallback] that can be used to get the send progress
  /// * [onReceiveProgress] - A [ProgressCallback] that can be used to get the receive progress
  ///
  /// Returns a [Future] containing a [Response] with a [ChildModeStartResponse] as data
